-Backend: Node.js, Express
-Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
-Authentication: JWT
-Security: bcrypt, cookie-based authentication

**Development Approach**
-Structured using the MVC architecture
-Followed SOLID principles and clean code practices
-Applied unit, integration, and smoke testing for reliability
-Designed with modularity and scalability in mind

**Purpose**
The system aims to modernize the library experience for the university by improving access, efficiency, and usability for both students and staff.
